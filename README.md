Welcome to my project! This is a basic "EmojiLover" app made in Swift.
It allows users to view and change an emoji on the display from a selection of different emojis.
There is no practical application of this app, but I created it to learn how to utilize XCode and Swift to develop an iOS app.
This is the first app I have developed so far and hopefully there will be more to come in the future. Thank you!
